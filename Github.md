Reducing the size of your Git repository by pruning old commit history and its related data is a common challenge. To achieve this, you can use the following strategies:

Git Garbage Collection (gc): Git has a built-in garbage collection process that helps to remove unreferenced or unreachable objects. To perform a full garbage collection, run the following command in your repository:
```
git gc --aggressive --prune=now
```
This command will clean up unnecessary files and reduce the repository size. Keep in mind that this can be a slow and resource-intensive process.

Shallow Clone: If you only need the recent commit history and don't require the entire repository's history, you can perform a shallow clone. This will fetch only the most recent commits and reduce the repository size significantly. Use the --depth option with git clone to specify the number of commits you want to fetch:
```
git clone --depth 1 <repository-url>
```
The --depth 1 flag will fetch only the latest commit.

Filter-Branch: If you want to remove old commits completely, you can use git filter-branch to rewrite the repository's history. Be cautious with this approach as it permanently removes historical commits. For example, to remove all commits before a specific date:
```
git filter-branch --tag-name-filter cat --prune-empty --subdirectory-filter <subdirectory> -- --all
```
Replace <subdirectory> with the path to your project's root if it's in a subdirectory.

BFG Repo-Cleaner: The BFG Repo-Cleaner is a more user-friendly option for removing large files or unwanted history. It's a third-party tool specifically designed for this purpose. Install it and use it as follows:
```
bfg --delete-files <file-to-delete> <repository>
```
The BFG Repo-Cleaner provides a safer and more controlled way to clean up your repository.

Use LFS for Large Files: If the majority of the repository's size is due to large binary files, consider using Git LFS (Large File Storage). This allows you to store large files outside of the Git repository, reducing the overall size.

GitHub Large File Storage: If your repository is hosted on GitHub, you can use GitHub's Large File Storage extension to manage and reduce the size of your repository.

Archive Old Commits: If you have a set of old commits that you want to preserve but don't need in the main repository, consider archiving them in a separate Git repository or an offline backup.
