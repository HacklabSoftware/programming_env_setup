# Pushing Code to GitHub: A Guide for New Software Developers

### 1. Prerequisites:

- Install Git on your system. Instructions can be found [here](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git).
- Create a GitHub account if you haven't already.
- Setup ssh for your account. Instructions can be found [here](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh)
- Set up your Git credentials locally using `git config`.

### 2. Initializing a New Repository:

- Create a new repository on GitHub.
- Add README.md in the main branch.
  - Add a brief description of the project.
- Now create a release branch.
  - Click on the branch button on the top left corner of the repository page.
  - Type in the name of the branch you want to create.
  - Select the main branch as the source.
  - Click on the Create Branch button.
- Now create a dev branch.
  - Click on the branch button on the top left corner of the repository page.
  - Type in the name of the branch you want to create.
  - Select the created feature branch as the source.
  - Click on the Create Branch button.
- `Add a git hook that will increment the version number in a file and every time you commit code. This will be shown in the production logs when the code is deployed.`

### 3. Adding Changes:

- After making changes to your code, run `git status` to view the changed files.
- Run `git add [filename]` to stage individual files or `git add .` to stage all changes.

### 4. Committing Changes:

- Run `git commit -m "Your meaningful commit message here"` to commit your changes.

### 5. Pushing Changes:

- Ensure you have the latest version from the main branch by running `git pull origin main` (or the branch you're working on).
- Run `git push origin main` (or the name of your branch) to push your committed changes to GitHub.

## The Importance of Pushing Code to GitHub

- **Version Control:** Git provides a comprehensive history of your project, allowing developers to track changes, revert to previous versions, and resolve conflicts more effectively.
- **Collaboration:** GitHub simplifies collaboration. Multiple developers can work on a project concurrently without overriding each other's changes.
- **Backup and Security:** Pushing to GitHub means there's an online backup of your code. GitHub also offers security features like vulnerability scanning to ensure your code is safe.
- **Continuous Integration and Deployment:** GitHub can be integrated with various CI/CD tools. As soon as you push your code, these tools can automatically build, test, and deploy your application.
- **Documentation:** The GitHub platform offers features like Wikis and READMEs, allowing developers to document their code, dependencies, and usage guidelines.

## Hacklab Specific Rules For Software Development Team

### Key Branches:

- **master:** Always production-ready.
- **dev:** Acts as an integration branch for feature branches. Contains code for the next release.
- **feat:** For new features, branched off develop and merged back into develop. All feature branches should follow the pattern with `feat/<feature-name>`
- **release:** Branched off develop when it's feature complete for a release. This branch prepares the code for production by making necessary adjustments and bug fixes. Once ready, it's merged to master and develop. All release branches should follow the pattern `release/<release-version>`
- **hotfix:** Emergency fixes directly branched from master and merged back to both master and dev. All hotfix branches should follow the pattern `hotfix/<issue-number or name>`

## Step-by-Step Development Instructions

1. **Fork the repo you want to work on**

   - Fork the repository.
     - Click on the Fork button on the top right corner of the repository page.
     - Select your account as the destination.

2. **Setting up Your Local Environment:**

   - Clone the forked repository to your local machine.
   - Ensure you have the latest version of both the dev and master branches.

3. **Creating a New Branch for Development:**

   - From the dev branch, create a new feature or bugfix branch: `git checkout -b feat/<your-feature-name>`.

4. **Making Code Changes:**

   - Develop your feature or fix the bug in your branch.
   - Regularly commit your changes with meaningful commit messages.

5. **Once development is completed:**

   - Pull merge the latest changes from the dev branch of central repo to your dev branch.
     - Run `git checkout dev` to switch to the dev branch.
     - Run `git pull origin dev` to pull the latest changes from the dev branch of central repo to your local dev branch.
   - Merge the latest changes from your feature branch to your dev branch.
     - Run `git merge feat/<your-feature-name> --no-ff` to merge the latest changes from your feature branch to the dev branch.
     - Fix any merge conflicts that may arise.
   - Push your changes to the remote repository.
     - Run `git push origin dev` to push your changes to the remote repository.
   - Create a pull request from your dev branch to the dev branch of central repo.

6. **Ensure Code Passes GitHub Actions:**

   - Before submitting a pull request, make sure your code passes all GitHub Actions set up for the branch.

7. **Resolve Conflicts:**

   - If there are any merge conflicts between your branch and the dev or master branch, resolve them locally.
   - Ensure there are 0 merge conflicts before proceeding.

8. **Create a Pull Request:**

   - Push your branch to the remote repository: git push origin your-feature-name.
   - On GitHub, create a pull request from your branch to the target branch (either dev or master).
   - Notify the team about the pull request so they are aware and can review.

9. **Request for Review:**

   - Once your pull request is up, and you've ensured the above conditions are met, request a review from the appropriate team members or maintainers.

10. **Address Reviewer Feedback:**

    - Carefully consider the feedback from the reviewer.
    - Make necessary changes in your branch based on the suggestions.
    - Commit and push these new changes to your branch.

11. **Repeat Review Steps:**

    - The reviewer will look at your updated code.
    - Repeat steps 8 and 9 until the reviewer is satisfied with your changes.

12. **Final Approval and Merge:**

    - Once the reviewer approves the code, they (or someone with the appropriate permissions) will merge it back to the respective target branch (dev or master).

**Make sure to follow these steps diligently for every feature or bugfix. This process ensures code quality, seamless integration, and efficient collaboration among team members.**

## Do's and Don'ts for Development

### Do's:

- `Use git merge --no-ff to merge your feature branch to dev branch.`
- Name your branch meaningfully, indicating the purpose or feature.
- Commit often with clear and concise commit messages.
- Frequently pull changes from the remote repository to stay updated.
- Make sure to run all tests and ensure they pass before submitting a pull request.
- Resolve all conflicts locally, ensuring your code integrates seamlessly.
- Provide a detailed description in your pull request of the changes made.
- Tag the appropriate team members for review.
- Respectfully consider all feedback and make necessary changes.
- Stay engaged and responsive as the review progresses.
- Ensure your code has been reviewed and approved before merging.
- Regularly prune and manage your local and remote branches to keep things tidy.

### Don'ts:

- `Start work without first ensuring you're working off the latest codebase.`
- Work directly on dev or master.
- Mix multiple features or fixes in a single commit.
- Ignore merge conflicts or changes in the remote repository.
- Submit code that doesn't pass tests or GitHub Actions.
- `Merge conflicted code into the dev or master branches.`
- Create a pull request without a clear description or without notifying the team.
- Push through with merges without a proper review.
- Disregard reviewer feedback or engage in unconstructive arguments.
- Assume one round of feedback is enough; be prepared for multiple iterations.
- `Merge without proper approval or without ensuring all CI checks have passed.`
